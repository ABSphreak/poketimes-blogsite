## Branches

There are two branches:

1. `master` → React Code ⚛
2. `gh-pages` → Deployment build 🌐

## Available Scripts

In this project you can run,

### `npm run deploy`

Deploys the app to github-pages assuming the URL specified in `package.json`.<br />

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. <br/>
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
